## Progress summary 
In this milestone 5 we have revise and improve our code and test for the functions that we previously created and for the rest of the function (payment system, post system, handle order, shopping cart).

**Payment system**: shows the amount of the order and currency, if the card number and CVV is correct, the payment will be made successfully.

**Handle order system**: 1. add or delete orders 2. test update order status (shipping status)3. update order status (this is by the clerk). 
<br />
**Shopping cart**: the system can remove item, add item, and sum up the total price in the shopping cart.

**Post function**: post text and image on the website but system will verified if the user has been log in first. 


## Comment on the progress
To update current progress for this milestone, we have successfully pass CI for all of our functions. There are still few parts we need revise which is the post function and search function. Post function requires mySQL which is hard to check automatically, therefore, we will need to test manually. Search function requires improve on the code. We think we are pretty close to finish, the only thing we left is the user interface, which we will be planing to finished maybe this or next week ish.
